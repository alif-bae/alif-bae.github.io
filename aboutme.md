### Hi, I’m Ali. 
Some say I engineer software, Impostor Syndrome would have me believing that I just know how to google better than most other people. I convinced myself to blog about all the strange, interesting and downright whacky things I come across while programming. I notice that I end up googling the same answers to trivial (and some not so trivial) problems frequently so I thought, “why not keep them all in one place? Someone else might also find my solution.

#### Here are a few other things I do:
- Electronic Music Production with Ableton Live 
- Strength Training
- Automating the Boring Stuff 

PS: If you feel like hitting me up, check the footer for my contact information!
