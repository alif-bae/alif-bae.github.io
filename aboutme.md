### Hi, I’m Ali. 
Some say I engineer software, I just know how to google better than most other people. I write hacky scripts to do things. I convinced myself to blog about all the strange things I encounter while programming. I notice that I end up googling the same answers to trivial (and some not so trivial) problems frequently so I thought, “why not keep them all in one place? Someone else might also find my solution (read: jugaar) [urdu - slang for a very hacky solution to a problem] useful.

#### Here are a few other things I do:
- Electronic Music Production with Ableton Live 
- Tryharding at DOTA
- Strength Training 
- Automating boring stuff

PS: If you feel like hitting me up, check the footer for my contact information!
