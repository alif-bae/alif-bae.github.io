### Hi, I’m Ali. 
I make websites (well, I try) and write very hacky scripts. I recently convinced myself to blog about all the strange things I encounter while programming. I notice that I end up googling the same answers to trivial (and some not so trivial) problems frequently so I thought, “why not keep them all in one place? Someone else might also find my solution (read: jugaar) [urdu - slang for a very hacky solution to a problem] useful.

#### Here are a few other things I do:
- I like learning about new technologies
- I'm a very try hard Dota player
- Sometimes when I get bored I play guitar
- Deep House is life *undst undst undst*
- I'm currently really into Electronic Music Production with FL Studio
- On wednesdays I wear pink
