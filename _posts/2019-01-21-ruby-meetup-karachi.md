### Just Another Day At The Office
It seemed like a regular workday like any other, the usual humdrum of the office space happening around me. I strolled to the cafeteria in Creative Chaos' office to make my morning cup of coffee and get settled in for another day of work. As I poured the steaming water in my cup a colleague of mine ([Sarmad](https://twitter.com/syedsarmadsabih)) was walking in at the same time in the kitchen. We exchanged our usual greeting after which he mentioned something about a developer conference happening in a couple of weeks from then.  Talking about it some more I learned it was about wanting to start community for students and professionals, sharing knowledge and more importantly, building and maintaining a sense of *comradery* among ourselves. He asked me if I was interested. 

I was intrigued, but hesitant. This required my time, and if there's anything I'm critical about in life, it's about spending my time wisely. "Oh joy", thought my cynical self, another thing that wants my time. Sarmad mentioned that this sit-down was meant to discuss how to carry out this event, since it was the first of its kind in Karachi. He asked me if I wanted to present on a topic and I told him that since I was preoccupied with some major life events at the time and wouldn't be able to make any commitments. He asked me to just attend if not participate and I agreed. 

### A Sense Of Belonging
The the following Sunday morning I arrived at the rendezvous point for our sit-down and started began getting to know the various people who were part of this new venture. There were around 8 of us, all of whom were professionals in the industry working with various organizations such as [10Pearls](https://10pearls.com/), [nybbletech](https://www.nybbletech.com/), [Creative Chaos](https://creativechaos.co/) and some were even self-employed! Soon after the last member of our collective had arrived I surveyed the table and realized that I was the youngest and least experienced member present there. Regardless of my experience I felt welcome among these people. The vibe was open and everyone's opinions and ideas were being thrown on the table for discussion. Everyone was respectful, everyone got the space to speak their mind and share their opinions. We spoke about the structure of the event, the various topics we should talk about and soon enough everyone started volunteering for taking on different topics. 

I feel its important to mention that up-to point I was still hesitant in presenting on a topic, but having interacted with these folks and getting to know them a little more personally, I felt encouraged to take on that responsibility. It was decided, we were going to start the **"Ruby Meetup Karachi"**, the first ever Ruby developer's meetup in Karachi. It was going to be graciously hosted by [10Pearls University](https://www.facebook.com/10Pearls-University-189837701420316/) on their premises. We said our goodbyes and I returned back home with the goal of presenting my chosen topic to the best of my ability, feeling motivated by having a great experience talking to these new people. *They were even kind enough to pay for my coffee.*

### Preparations Underway
In the few weeks leading up to the event a few members reached out to  [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://dhh.dk/) (commonly referred to by his twitter handle [@dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh)) the creator of Ruby on Rails and the founder/CTO of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com). We wanted to inform him about our  meetup happening in Karachi and ask if they could give us a shout-out for some online presence.

#### It was a long shot

#### We even received a blessing from Yukihiro Matsumoto (commonly known as [Matz](https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz) in the Ruby world), the creator of Ruby himself!

### The Event
The event kicked off with a keynote by **Shehzad Ali**, who gave a very comprehensive introduction to Ruby and how it empowers developers to getting things done all the while being a joy to work with. He showed how Ruby is both easy to pick up and yet difficult to master, like any skill worth putting your time into.

The next talk was given a good friend and coworker, **Usman Imam**, who spoke about a common problem that every application needs to solve: How to authenticate and authorize users on a platform.

We took a break for some refreshments after which I presented on the nuances of background processing with Ruby on Rails. The talk revolved around the various solutions available to people developing a Rails application, and when to use a certain library depending on the use-case. 

The next talk happened to be one of my favorites, given by **Ali Ahmed**.  who spoke about the different ways we can use and interact with JavaScript in Rails. I personally learned a lot from this talk; learned how `StimulusJS` works and how we can leverage the power of `turbo-links` in Rails to make monolithic single page apps for quick and easy builds. It was one of the more 'hands-on' talks with new ways to do things that I hadn't encountered before.

Soon after that, **Akif Ateef** gave a demonstrative talk on testing using Ruby on Rails. The talk involved him showing the audience how quickly a simple test suite can be set up using `Rspec` and `cucumber`. He also spoke extensively about Test and Behavior Driven Development. 

Last but not least, one of the most technically demanding talks was given by **Sarmad Sabih**, "Deploy Like A Pro" revolved around using various services provided by Amazon Web Services to deploy a Rails application from scratch. We learned about configuring _auto-scalers, load balancers, RDS servers_ and the likes to setup the infrastructure for the apps that we build. An activity developers usually delegate to DevOps engineers. Watching Sarmad set all this up in under an hour demonstrated that this is indeed possible for anyone with a little bit of grit, focus and determination.

### A Closing Note
Since this was our first foray in starting a developer conference, we obviously made a few mistakes. Rest assured we talked about them at length and are trying our best to learn from them. From talks that stretched for too long, the various technical difficulties we faced, and to a conscious realization of the lack of representation of women presenters. We want to address those issues in future sessions of a similar nature. 

I'd like to thank 10Pearls for hosting this event, my colleagues from Creative Chaos who took time out from their weekends to attend this event and everyone else who stuck with us for as long as they did.
