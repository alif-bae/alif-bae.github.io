title: Using ssh with github for dummies
---

lets be real, if you've been using an http remote to push your commits to github you probably already hate your life for having to keep re-entering your username and password ALL THE GODDAMNED TIME! But...what if it didn't have to be that way? What if there was an easier way to do this? What if... *gasp* what if you used SSH?

Okay enough of me being a drama llama preacher of all things good about SSH. Lets get cracking. 
This tutorial is meant for linux and Mac users.
